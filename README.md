# mouse-api-images

This is the collection of images served by Mouse API.

The 'mouse' in Mouse API is taken very loosely. We welcome all manner of rodentia, lagomorpha, cursor technology, and beyond.

If you would like to contribute to this project, submit your image as a Pull Request for review.

All images submitted will be made accessible via Mouse API endpoints.

## Submission Guide
* Please ensure your photos are of a good quality and the 'mouse' is easily identifiable in the photo
* Feel free to suggest new categories to include by creating a new directory for it
